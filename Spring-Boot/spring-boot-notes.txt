 mvn to springbootproject
  1. add <parent> spring boot starter -- opiniated framework - this has basic recommended config with a specific version which work well together - bill of material ; maven project is basically has child parent dependencies 
  2. mvn is dependency manager - add <dependencies> ; spring boot has meta depencies - ie dependency having multiple jar for dependecies of a type of project - version taken from <parent>
  3. to import specific properties <properties>
  
 Spring boot can be stand alone application - show main method with annotation @SprinBootApplication - use static method SpringApplication.run(c lass , arg) to create and host app in  servelet container with default config.
 
 application context :- spring acts as container for diff services (controller , services etc) 	

Customize spring boot application using application.properties  
 
@Controller 
	- java class -  has info about
		1. what URI acess triggers it
		2. what HTTP method used (GET POST etc )
		3. method to run based on 1 & 2	
	
		@RequestMapping maps only GET by default- others have to specified
	
	Spring MVC auto converts return values into JSON (if @RESTController used)
	
	@Autowired - used to declare member variables of a class which needs dependecies injection
	
@Service
	- has bussiness logic as methods
	singleton - when app starts up, spring keeps an instance of this in memory
	
JPA - java persistence API- specification that helps with ORM (obeject Relation mapping ) with DB

	ORM - map entity classes into SQL tables when we connect to DB 

@Entity
		@Id :- primary key
		other JPA entity relationships also available  like:- @ManyToOne		

	Spring Data JPA has standardard methods in CrudRepository  which can be extended to your interface
	
		CrudRepository is genric type
	
		Can create custom methods in the interface - sometimes dont have to implement the method, declaring the method with Spring JPA format (eg: to find an id by a property: - findByProperty(var_type id)) and Spring JPA will implement it
		

Spring Boot Actuator - has prod ready feature to help monitor and manage application - new endpoint can be added for seeing health etc (has other features)
